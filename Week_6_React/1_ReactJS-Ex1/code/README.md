# My First React App

This is a simple React website that I created to learn web development.

## How to Use This Project

### Step 1: Install Everything You Need
Before you can run this project, you need to install all the required files:
```
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start the Website
To see your website in action:
```
npm start
```
This will open your website at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
The website will automatically update when you make changes to your code!

### Step 3: Run Tests (Optional)
To check if your code is working correctly:
```
npm test
```

### Step 4: Build for Real Website (Advanced)
When you're ready to put your website online:
```
npm run build
```
This creates a special folder with all the files needed for a real website.

## What's Inside?
- **src/App.js** - This is where you write your main website code
- **src/index.js** - This file starts up your React app
- **public/index.html** - The basic HTML page that loads your React app
- **package.json** - Lists all the tools and libraries this project uses
