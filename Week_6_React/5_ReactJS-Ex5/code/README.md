# React Cohort Management App

This is a simple web application built with React (a popular library for creating websites). The app helps manage cohorts (groups of students or participants) and shows their details.

## What This App Does

This app displays information about different cohorts, including:
- Cohort names and descriptions
- Participant details
- Easy navigation between different cohorts

## How to Use This App

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If you don't have it, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 1: Install Everything You Need
Open your command line/terminal in this folder and type:
```
npm install
```
This downloads all the necessary files to run the app.

### Step 2: Start the App
Type this command to start the app:
```
npm start
```
After a few seconds, your web browser will automatically open and show the app at `http://localhost:3000`. 

**Cool feature:** When you make changes to the code, the webpage automatically refreshes to show your changes!

### Step 3: Run Tests (Optional)
To check if everything is working correctly, type:
```
npm test
```
This runs automatic checks to make sure the app is functioning properly.

### Step 4: Prepare for Publishing (Advanced)
When you're ready to put your app on the internet, type:
```
npm run build
```
This creates an optimized version of your app that loads faster for users.

- `src/` folder: Contains all your app's code
- `public/` folder: Contains images and the main HTML file
- `package.json`: Lists all the tools and libraries your app uses
